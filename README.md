## About

After one year of college, I chose to drop out and pursue my passion for web development. I learned front-end development through youtube & udemy courses. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, and Three.js. I am also familiar with TypeScript and Framer motion. I am always looking to learn new technologies.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess, watching movies, and chilling out with my friends. I also have a keen interest in learning new things. Currently, I'm delving into philosophy--it's like diving into the depths of life's big questions.
